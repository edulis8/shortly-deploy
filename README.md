# Shortly Deploy
I completed this sprint when I was a student at [Hack Reactor Remote Beta](http://www.hackreactor.com/remote-beta).

An URL shortening app built with Backbone.js. 

In this sprint I:

- Used Grunt to concat and minify JS and CSS files.
- Deployed the app to Heroku using a [Grunt buildpack](https://github.com/mbuchetics/heroku-buildpack-nodejs-grunt)
- Refactored the database from SQLlite to MongoDB.
- Added persistence via MongoDB to the deployed app with [mLab](https://mlab.com/)
